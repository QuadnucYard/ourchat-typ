  message(right, customer)[
    Hi! I'm having trouble with the API authentication. Getting a 401 error.
  ],

  message(left, support)[
    Hello! I'd be happy to help you with the authentication issue.

    Could you please share the code you're using for the API request?
  ],

  message(right, customer)[
    Sure! Here's my code:

    ```javascript
    fetch('/api/data', {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer my-token'
      }
    })
    ```
  ],

  message(left, support)[
    I see the issue! The token format should include "Bearer " prefix. Try this:

    ```javascript
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${your_actual_token}`
    }
    ```

    Also make sure your token hasn't expired (they're valid for 24 hours).
  ],

  message(right, customer)[
    Oh! I was using a placeholder. Let me try with the real token...

    It works now! Thank you so much! ðŸŽ‰
  ],

  message(left, support)[
    Excellent! Glad we could resolve that quickly.

    Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions. Have a great day! âœ¨
