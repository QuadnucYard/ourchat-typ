    Help! Getting a weird error in production ðŸ˜°

    ```
    Error: Connection timeout after 30s
    at Database.connect (db.js:45)
    ```
  ],

  message(left, senior)[
    Can you share your database connection config? (remove sensitive data)
  ],

  message(left, developer)[
    Sure! Here's the config:

    ```javascript
    const config = {
      host: 'db.example.com',
      port: 5432,
      database: 'myapp',
      connectionTimeoutMillis: 30000,
      pool: { min: 5, max: 20 }
    }
    ```
  ],

  message(left, devops)[
    @junior_dev Check if the database server is experiencing high load

    Also try increasing the timeout to 60s temporarily
  ],

  message(left, senior)[
    Good point! Also check your connection pool settings:

    ```javascript
    pool: {
      min: 2,
      max: 10,  // Reduce max connections
      idleTimeoutMillis: 10000
    }
    ```
  ],

  message(left, developer)[
    That fixed it! Thanks team! ðŸŽ‰

    Pool was exhausted due to too many concurrent connections
  ],
